#In this simulated dataset, brook trout activity (movements/hr) declines as stream temperature increases. Streams with cold-water refugia have higher baseline activity and a weaker decline in activity with increasing temperature compared to streams without refugia. The ANCOVA model tests whether the slopes of activity–temperature relationships differ between the two stream types, answering this ecological question: Do brook trout with cold-water refugia maintain higher activity levels as temperatures rise compared to those without refugia?

###PART 2###

#this simulated data represents the relationship between critical thermal maximum values (maximum temperature a fish can tolerate before losing the ability to maintain an upright posture when temperature is increased gradually) of both male and female herring and fish length. In some species, it is reported that females have higher CTmax values overall; however, this may depend on factors such as age and reproductive status.

#Question: Does the relationship between body length and critical thermal maximum differ between male and female herring?

# FINAL MODEL DECISION
###############################
# Based on p-values and ANOVA model comparison, the slope of CTmax vs mass does not differ between males and females, so we can justify removing the interaction. But after removing the interaction, both mass and sex are significant. Larger fish tend to have a higher CTmax, and males have lower overall CTmax than females by about 2 degrees.

#my partner compared almost identically with my partner, with my parameter estimates being really close to the true values. We both came to the same conclusions about removing the interaction. l
